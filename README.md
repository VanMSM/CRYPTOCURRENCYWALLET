# THE CRYPTOCURRENCY PAY APP


![Unknown-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80144026/129491906-8c6dc3d8-085e-425e-9765-42bc323b414d.jpeg)



This is a payment application, which is integrated with the Ethereum blockchain network. It enables users to instantly pay/send cryptocurrency payments. I used the example of hiring a fintech professional for a contract job and paying the candidate with Ether. This application, once fine tuned,  would be great for people who send money internationally as remittance fees are very high, consumer to merchant transfers and peer to peer money transfers.

## How to Use

* In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the Streamlit application by using "streamlit run Fintech_Finder.py"
* On the resulting webpage, select a candidate that you would like to hire from the appropriate drop-down menu. Then, enter the number of hours that you would like to hire them for.
* Click the Send Transaction button to sign and send the transaction with your Ethereum account information. If the transaction is successfully
communicated to the Ethereum Kovan testnet, validated, and added to a block, a resulting transaction hash code will be written to the Streamlit application sidebar.
* Copy the customerâ€™s (your) Ethereum address from the Streamlit application page, and navigate to [Kovan Etherscan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/).
* On the Kovan Etherscan page, click on the search bar and enter your ethereum address or the transaction Hash number associated with the transaction that paid the Fintech Finder candidate, click on the transaction details to verify payment success.
